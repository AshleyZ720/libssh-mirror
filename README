libssh: the SSH library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


1* Why ?
-_-_-_-_-_

Why not ? :) I've began to work on my own implementation of the ssh protocol
because i didn't like the currently public ones.
Not any allowed you to import and use the functions as a powerful library, 
and so i worked on a library-based SSH implementation which was non-existing
in the free and open source software world.


2* How/Who ?
-_-_-_-_-_-_-_

If you downloaded this file, you must know what it is : a library for
accessing ssh client services through C libraries calls in a simple manner.
Everybody can use this software under the terms of the LGPL - see the COPYING
file

If you ask yourself how to compile libssh, please read INSTALL before anything.

3* Where ?
