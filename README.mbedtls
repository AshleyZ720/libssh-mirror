When built with mbedTLS, libssh currently does not support ECDSA key comparison.
Since the comparison function is used during the verification of publickey
authentication requests a libssh server will not be able to deal with ECDSA
keys.

In general, if the ssh_key_cmp function is used with mbedTLS, ECDSA key
comparison won't work.
